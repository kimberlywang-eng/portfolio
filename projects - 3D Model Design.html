								<h2>Design Process</h2>
								<div class="box">
									<p>During my internship at Tesla, one of my coworkers proposed the idea of adding 3D modelling into my website. Although, 
										it was hard at the beginning because I was balancing work, research, and Texas Guadaloop during the day, I finally got the 
										chance to do it during Spring Break. Here is the product:
										<a href="projects - 3D Model.html">click here.</a>
									</p>
									
									<h3>Overview Process</h3>
									<p>
									<p><center>Goal: Input a 3D model into the website</center></p>
											<ol>
												<span class="image right"><img src="images/baymax-code.jpg" alt="" /></span>
												<li>Learn about three.js from its animation and the backend of pushing the code for UI (user-interface) could see the animation.</li>
												<li>Get a free 3D model to apply knowledge</li>
												<li>Put 3D model on website</li>
												<li>Animate the 3D model on the website</li>
											</ol>
									</p>	
									<h3>Knowledge/Research (Started: March 21, 2023)</h3>
										<h5>Day 1</h5>
										<ul>
										<li>Applied three.js by adding NPM (Node Package Manager) by installing node.js</li>
										<li>**Note: Remember to restart Visual Studio Code after installing node.js (or the code won't work).</li>
										</ul>
										<h5>Challenges: Day 1</h5>
										<ul>
										<li>Three.js wasn't reading.</li>
										<p>&nbsp The code wasn't loading when the code was using <code>script</code> command. I tried to debug and noticed the code wasn't going 
											through the command. The website had a black placeholder for where the animation was located. I tried to adjust the light/camera, but that didn't work.</p>
										</ul>
									<h3>Applied Knowledge (Started: June 12-13, 2023)</h3>
										<h5>Day 2</h5>
											<ul>
												<span class="image  right"><img src="images/wall-e proto.jpg" alt="" /></span>
												<li>Researched other ways to implement a 3D model into the website: <code>model-viewer</code></li>
												<li>Find a .glb 3D model file or convert a file to a .glb and was free for the public</li>
												<p>&nbsp Later, I found a Baymax as a .glb file, but that didn't work as the .obj wasn't a smooth surfaces and had additional subfolders for its skin. I had converted a Wall-E that was 
													a .rar file, but later found a .glb file of Wall-E. The Wall-E was there, but it didn't work as it was too big of a file for the website to be converted. I used a smaller Wall-E file for it to work.</p>
											</ul>
										
										<h5>Challenges: Day 2</h5>
											<ul>
												<li><code>model-viewer</code> only supported .glb files</li>
												<li>Baymax had too many subfolders for website to output the correct look for Baymax.</li>
												<li>File size for Wall-E</li>
											</ul>
										<p><center>The Wall-E was my first animation on this website that worked!</center></p>
										<h5>Day 3 (LET'S ANIMATE!)</h5>
											<span class="image left"><img src="images/mixamo_skeleton.png" alt="" /></span>
											<p>Thoughts: I wanted to then make the 3D model as animated like three.js model. After, some searching on Google and three.js, I found that I can use model-viewer to animate a 3D Model on the website</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Researched how to animate in <code>model-viewer</code></li>
												<li>Figured out: an animation software Mixamo to animate 3D models.</li>
												<p> &nbsp I want to try Mixamo but the files import wasn't the correct type, too big, or couldn't find the skeleton for the 3D model. 
													The control the .glb files to Mixamo and export it as a .glb. Mixamo only accepts .fbx, .obj, and .zip, so I would have to convert to a .glb for <code>model-viewer</code>
												</p>
												<li>Found a website with a 3D dinosaur model animation</li>
												<span class="image right"><img src="images/mixamo_baymax.png" alt="" /></span>
												<li>UI to have a boarder (later didn't like it) and added buttons by combining logic in <code>model-viewer</code> from the three.js website and 
													examples in the documentation of the <code>model-viewer</code> and three.js websites.</li>
													<p> &nbsp The user can control the dinosaur's animation. I also want to slider to used as a speed and button of types of animations.</p>
											</ul>
										<h5>Challenges: Day 3</h5>
											<ul>
												<li><code>model-viewer</code> can animate if the .glb file and 3D model already have an animation already in the file. Solution: Mixamo</li>
											</ul>

												<li>Coming Soon</li>
											</ul>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/FinalProduct - TransparentTop.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
									
									<h3>Skills Learned</h3>
											<ul>
												<li><code>model-viewer</code> and three.js</li>
												<li>3D model in websites</li>
												<li>Animating 3D model for UI</li>
											</ul>
									<h3>Improvements and Challenges</h3>
											<ul>
												<li>Animate and input my own 3D model</li>
												<li>Apply the dinosaur's skin. The dinosaur has a skin color, but somehow the skin isn't showing up. The texture is shown, but not the skin.</li>
												<li>Allow the slider to have more drastic changes in speed of the dinosaur's animation</li>
											</ul>		
									<h3>Overall Thoughts</h3>
										<p>I always love to create, explore, and innovate on designs and especially 3D designs. It was amazing to find out and apply these 3D models into code after 
											one of my coworkers at Tesla suggested it. I think that the three.js isn't working because other .js files in the html code that overrides 
											the three.js inputting the animation into the website. It was cool to see inspiration from three.js and <code>model-viewer</code> website and apply those 
											examples into the code and see my imagination come to life on the website. From my internship with Tesla, I learned to take big projects like this one and break
											it down to smaller steps. Day 1 and 2: I wanted to just apply a simple 3D model like Wall-E without animations to see if it worked. Day 3: I wanted to take it a 
											step further after I saw the 3D model working with inputting animations. 											
										</p>
										<p><center>Moral of the story: “Thank you, coffeee and sleep and the internet and hope to further improve the website.” </center></p>
