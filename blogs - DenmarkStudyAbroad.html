									<h1>Study Abroad in Denmark<br />
									</h1>
									<p>On Dec 3, 2021. I was one of a few accepted to a class called Advanced Nanotechnology & Innovation in Copenhagen taught by Dr. Brian Korgel, an esteemed professor and the Director of The University of Texas at Austin Energy Institute.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/StudyAbroad.png" alt="" /></div>
								<p>To summarize: Studying Abroad has been one of the highlights of my school years.
									I was able to blogging/vlogging my study abroad experience that took place from May-June 2022!</p>
							<h3>Week 1</h3>
								<p>The first time I ever travelled to Europe and all by myself on a flight. I packed the night before and was didn't have any jet lag. 
									I said a bitter sweet goodbye to my parents who woke up at 3am to drive me to airport. I was a little nervous but very excited to be achieving one of 
									my dreams before I knew what college I wanted to go to. My flight was at 7:15am and had a connecting flight at to Miami that flew at 3:40pm.
								</p>
								<p> I remember the flight clearly because I was missing my brother's high school graduation. I am so incredibly proud of him. I remember seeing the international
									flights for the first time. I was so estatic by the TV screens, blankets, pillows, and food they give you.
								</p>
								<p> The moment I touched Denmark on Wed, May 25 there was a group from DIS (the program hosting UT students in Denmark) to drive us in a VIP van to our housing. The group of students I was 
									with had orientation and greeted so nicely by the host. We got our own apartment space and there was a school across the apartment. I quickly left my stuff and went to explore. 
									The group I went with went to explore and find food. There was so much beautiful sights around that I took to explore around every second.
								</p>
								<p>Fri, May 27 there was an excursion planned for a boat on Denmark's canel. It was a great introduction to the history of Denmark. After, the boat ride, a group and I 
									went to explore and ate at a great restaurant in the city center of Denmark and explored around Tivoli and downtown. We took pictures of downtown and the Queen's estate.
									It came night and explored the night of Denmark as peaceful. I would compare Denmark as Seattle's weather: rainy and cold.
