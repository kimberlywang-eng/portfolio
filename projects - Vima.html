									<h2>Purpose</h2>
									<blockquote>Feb 26-27, 2022: I competed in my first ever Hackathon by developing an application to branch 
										off my knowledge from python and expand my coding language.</blockquote>

								<h2>Design Process</h2>
								<div class="box">
									<p>I just finished my first coding class learning python. One of my CS friends wanted to join a Hackathon, but needed 
										more people and asked a couple friends and I. I always wanted to partcipate in a Hackathon and I thought this was
										the perfect opportunity.
									</p>
									<p>The Hackathon began with partcipants having the opportunity to pick from different categories to compete in. Our group
										thought it was logical to try to fit our product to as many categories as we can, but we soon found out 
										it was best to pick one main category to focus in - education. 
									</p>
									<p>The main issue is to design, code, and pitch a product within 24 hrs.</p>
									
									<h3>Overview Process</h3>
									<p>
											<ol>
												<li>Identify a problem -- hard to find study spaces</li>
												<span class="image right"><img src="images/vima_logo.png" alt="" /></span>
												<li>Design an application to allow students to find study spaces faster</li>
												<li>Figure out the best open-source framework for diverse applications for platform capabilities - React Native</li>
												<li>Code each essential components</li>
												<li>Develop a presentation</li>
												<li>Pitch to a panel of judges</li>
											</ol>

									<h3>Thought Process</h3>
										<p>After, our team decided to focus our works on developing an application to help find study spaces faster. We decided to split 
											the tasks needed to be done as developing a presentation and coding the product. I wanted to code since I wanted to grasp and 
											apply topics I wanted the previous semester. I approach the product by researching via YouTube and Google.</p>
										<p>I never designed an application before, but I knew I wanted to have the capabilities of working across multiple different
											platforms (i.e. Andriod and IPhones). I talked with one of the mentors and he suggested React Native as a suitable program
											to fit our needs. I split the work with me focusing on the front end of the application of GPS signal. Since I had extra
											time at the end of the Hackathon I was able to help the other person with the log-in interface.
										</p>
																		
									<h3>Skills Learned</h3>
											<ul>
												<li>Communication and delegating tasks to other members to meet time constriant</li>
												<li>Importance and urgency to ask for help from mentors to meet time constraint and to be constantly working to overcome obstacles</li>
												<li>Resistance</li>
												<li>JavaScript by using React Native</li>
												<li>Flexible and adaptive to overcome challanges</li>
												<li>Presentation to pitch ideas to judges, mentors and managers</li>
											</ul>
									<h3>Overall Thoughts</h3>
										<p>The project thought me the power of resistance and importance of time management. The Hackathon pushed me to constantly ask question to experts
											and research. The time constraint pushed me to keep the project moving and overcome obstacles faster by asking and understanding 
										when I need help to avoid the project slowing down. It was so much fun growing in such a fast pace. </p>
										<p>After, 24 hrs of a sleepless night and a lot of coffee, we were able to produce a product that we were proud of. 
											It is also best to get wide range of feedback for designs from experts in Hackathon and industry. My team and I was able to win
											Best Education Hack and it was our first ever Hackathon! </p>
