									<h2>Purpose</h2>
									<blockquote>I always wanted to get into website development. I thought since I wasn't travelling anywhere because of COVID19 in the winter of 2022, I might as well try. I had prior python experience from taking CS303E class at UT without any prior experience of coding before taking that class. Although, the class was really rigorous, my knowledge of code really helped guide me to build this living product. </blockquote>

								<h2>Thought Process</h2>
								<div class="box">
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pythonCode.jpg" alt="" /></span>Although, the website is coded in HTML, I was able to quickly grasp the concept because of CS303E that taught me the valuable knowledge to write these lines of code in HTML. The code on the left is an example of the python is an example of my code from class and how a similar approach was used to assemble the code on the right.</p>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/websiteCode.jpg" alt="" /></span>However, HTML does have its difference with python, so how I approached this website is via YouTube and Google and self-taught myself in HTML. I would learn the difference keys in HTML and python and I felt like home. It took my back in time when I would speak to my grandma in Vietnamese and translate in English and how my brain had to consisently switch. Sometimes I would go to my default language, English or in this case python, which made the bugs easier to fix.</p>		
									<p>After, I completed the website to the best of my abilities, I decided to host this website on GitHub for free as a personal journal that others can read and learn from my mistakes.</p>

								<h3>Overall Thoughts</h3>
									<p>At the beginning, I always wanted to update the website, but just didn't have time with school. I knew Thanksgiving was the perfect 
										opportunity for me to revamp and update the website of what I have been up to. Since, the development I have talked to some of my 
										friends to ask for feedback on improving the website. One of the main issue was the email and form wasn't going through and the 
										problem was critical as a major bug in the website. The problem taught me to idea to take breaks and then try to approach the
										problem in different views instead of trying again and again the same method. I would approach the problem then finish a project or 
										blogs page.
									</p>
									<p>I hope the updates fascinate you as it did with me. Each project and blogs enabled me to grow into who I am. I am constantly
										changing and reminding myself to keep innovating outside of school.
									</p>
